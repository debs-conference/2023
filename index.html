              <h1>Objective</h1>
              <p>
                The ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event‚ÄêBased Systems (DEBS) is a premier venue for
                academia and industry to discuss cutting-edge research of event-based computing related to Big Data,
                AI/ML, IoT, and Distributed Systems in general. DEBS 2023 will be a forum dedicated to the dissemination
                of original research, the discussion of practical insights, and the reporting of experiences relevant to
                distributed and event‚Äêbased systems.
              </p>

          <p>
            The conference will be hosted by the University of Neuch√¢tel, situated at the heart of the French-speaking
            region of Switzerland. Arts and Humanities, Science, Law, and Economics and Business: with four faculties,
            the University of Neuch√¢tel is the smallest non-specialist university in Switzerland. It offers a far
            broader range of programmes than other similarly sized universities, while avoiding the anonymity and
            overfilled auditoria which characterise larger establishments. With fewer than 5,000 students, each of whom
            benefits from genuine connections with the teaching staff, the UniNE is an institution where people get to
            know one another and exchange ideas.

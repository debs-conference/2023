			      <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p align="justify">Over the past decade, the ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event‐Based Systems (DEBS) has become the premier venue for academia and industry to discuss cutting-edge research of event-based computing related to Big Data, AI/ML, IoT, and Distributed Systems. The objectives of the 2022 ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event‐Based Systems (DEBS 2022) are to provide a forum dedicated to the dissemination of original research, the discussion of practical insights, and the reporting of experiences relevant to distributed systems and event‐based computing. The DEBS 2022 research track will highlight two focus areas connected to crucial challenges of our times: <b>climate change and sustainability</b>, and the <b>COVID-19 pandemic</b>.</p>

      	The conference will be hosted by the University of Copenhagen. Founded in 1479, it is the oldest and largest university in Denmark. It is often ranked as the best university in Scandinavia and among the top Universities in Europe. The Department of Computer Science at University of Copenhagen (DIKU) is the first computer science department in Denmark, established by Peter Naur in 1970. Since then, our researchers and graduates have formed the basis for society’s accelerating technological transformation, and our research environment and results have made us one of Europe’s leading and most attractive computer science departments.

			      <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p align="justify">Over the past decade, the ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event‐Based Systems (DEBS) has become the premier venue for academia and industry to discuss cutting-edge research of event-based computing related to Big Data, AI/ML, IoT, and Distributed Systems. The objectives of the 2023 ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event‐Based Systems (DEBS 2023) are to provide a forum dedicated to the dissemination of original research, the discussion of practical insights, and the reporting of experiences relevant to distributed systems and event‐based computing.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p align="justify">
            The DEBS conference covers topics in distributed and event-based computing. The scope of the conference includes systems dealing with collecting, detecting, processing, and responding to events through distributed middleware and applications. Examples of application domains covered by the conference include the Internet of Things, sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, social networking, finance, transportation, healthcare and logistics, computer and network security. Technologies discussed include complex event recognition and forecasting, real-time analytics, reliability and resilience, distributed ledger and blockchains, energy management and green computing, data stream reasoning and modeling, big/fast data analysis, event processing for Artificial Intelligence and vice versa, security and encryption in stream processing, embedded systems, and cloud, peer-to-peer, ubiquitous and mobile computing. Topics relevant to enterprise-level computing include enterprise application integration, real-time enterprises, Web services, and support for enterprises to respond in a timely fashion to changing situations. The covered topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
            
            <p align="justify"><b>Models, architectures and paradigms</b>: Complex event processing, event-driven architectures, trustworthy event-based systems, real-time analytics, intelligent event processing, event processing in big and fast data, data stream processing, security and encryption in stream processing, complex event forecasting, in-network processing, logic-based complex event recognition, online relational learning, distributed event pattern learning, event correlation, and pattern languages.</p>
                  
            <p align="justify"><b>Systems and software</b>: Distributed data processing, distributed programming, federated event-based systems, AI/ML for event processing, information-centric networking, software-defined networking, security, reliability and resilience, distributed ledger and blockchains, programmable hardware, energy management, and green computing as well as cloud, fog, ubiquitous and mobile computing.</p>
			
            <p align="justify"><b>Applications</b>: Use cases, requirements, and applications of distributed and event-based systems in various domains including Internet-of-Things, life sciences, moving object applications, smart cities, cyber-physical systems, sensor networks, social networking, multimedia analytics, finance, healthcare and logistics, computer and network security, smart contracts, and blockchains. Also, relevant topics span enterprise-level computing, including enterprise application integration, real-time enterprises, event-based business process management, and support for enterprises to respond in a timely fashion to changing situations.</p>

                  <h2>Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
              
            <p align="justify">The DEBS community joins an integrated effort to promote diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our professional activities. DEBS 2023 participates in this effort alongside EDBT/ICDT, MDM, SIGMOD, VLDB, SoCC, and ICDE, to celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, sex, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, work experience, etc. It also welcomes people and opinions of all political persuasions, as long as they abide by the ACM policy against hate speech and harassment. </p>

      	The conference will be hosted by the University of Neuchâtel, situated at the heart of the French-speaking region of Switzerland. Arts and Humanities, Science, Law, and Economics and Business: with four faculties, the University of Neuchâtel is the smallest non-specialist university in Switzerland. It offers a far broader range of programmes than other similarly sized universities, while avoiding the anonymity and overfilled auditoria which characterise larger establishments. With fewer than 5,000 students, each of whom benefits from genuine connections with the teaching staff, the UniNE is an institution where people get to know one another and exchange ideas.

  title: A Unifying Model for Distributed Data-Intensive Systems
  affiliation: Politecnico di Milano Italy
  abstract: Modern applications handle increasingly larger volumes of data, generated at an unprecedented and constantly growing pace. They introduce challenges that are transforming all research fields that gravitate around data management and processing, resulting in a blooming of distributed data-intensive systems. Each data-intensive system comes with its specific assumptions, data and processing model, design choices, implementation strategies, and guarantees. Yet, the problems data-intensive systems face and the solutions they propose are frequently overlapping. This tutorial presents a unifying model for data-intensive systems that dissects them into core building blocks, enabling a precise and unambiguous description and a detailed comparison. We show a list of classification criteria that derive from the model and we use them to build a taxonomy of state-of-the-art systems. The tutorial aims to offer a global view of the vast research field of data-intensive systems, highlight interesting observations on the current state of things, and suggest promising research directions.

  title: Formal Models of Complex Event Recognition
  affiliation: University of Piraeus
  abstract: Complex Event Recognition (CER) refers to the activity of detecting patterns in streams of continuously arriving “event” data over (geographically) distributed sources. CER is a key ingredient of many contemporary Big Data applications that require the processing of such event streams in order to obtain timely insights and implement reactive and proactive measures. Examples of such applications include the recognition of attacks in computer network nodes, human activities on video content, emerging stories and trends on the Social Web, traffic and transport incidents in smart cities, error conditions in smart energy grids, violations of maritime regulations, cardiac arrhythmias and epidemic spread. In each application, CER allows to make sense of streaming data, react accordingly, and prepare for counter-measures. In this tutorial, we will present the formal methods for CER, as they have been developed in the artificial intelligence community. To illustrate the reviewed approaches, we will use the domain of maritime situational awareness.

  title: Hopsworks Feature Store
  affiliation: KTH Royal Institute of Technology
  abstract: Feature stores for machine learning are a new category of systems software that centralize the management of data for AI - for both training and serving data to models. They solve problems related to ensuring consistent transformations of data between training and serving, the reuse of pre-engineered features across different models, ensuring no future leakage in training data through point-in-time correct joins, and enabling collaboration between different personas putting AI in production, including data engineers, data scientists, and ML engineers. In this tutorial, we will present the historical evolution of feature stores and the needs that drove their development. We will deep dive into the first open-source feature store, Hopsworks, and how you can use Hopsworks to build both an analytical ML application and an operational ML application. This will involve showing an end-to-end system that includes feature engineering, the feature store, model training,  and pipeline orchestration. You will need experience in programming in Python, some knowledge of Pandas will be helpful, but no prior experience of machine learning is needed - just enthusiasm for building real-world machine learning systems.
    
  biography: Jim Dowling is CEO of Hopsworks and an Associate Professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. He is one of the main developers of the open-source Hopsworks platform, a horizontally scalable data platform for machine learning that includes the industry’s first Feature Store. His research interests are in the areas of distributed file systems, decentralized systems, and systems support for real-time machine learning. Jim is a former Marie Curie Scholar, and has won awards for his research including the IEEE Scale Prize, awarded by CCGrid, for his work on the HopsFS file system. Jim is a regular speaker at industry conferences on data and AI and is currently writing a book on feature stores for Manning.

  title: "Apache Wayang (Incubating): Performing AIoT Seamlessly"
  affiliation: TU Berlin and DFKI
  abstract: "We are living in a data deluge era, where data is being generated by a large number of sources. This just got exacerbated with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT). Nowadays, a large number of different devices are generating data at an unprecedented scale: smartphones, smartwatches, embedded sensors in cars, smart homes, wearable technology, just to mention a few. We are simply surrounded by data without even noticing it. This represents a great opportunity to improve our everyday lives by using the new advances in AI, also called AIoT. Connecting IoT with data storage and AI technology is just gaining more and more attention. Yet, performing AIoT in an efficient and scalable manner is a cumbersome task. Today, users have to implement different ad hoc solutions to move data from the IoT to “stable” storage on which they can perform AI (typically on the Cloud). In this tutorial, we will discuss and learn how Apache Wayang (Incubating) frees users from this burden. In particular, we explain how Wayang enables users to seamlessly run their AI tasks on the Fog and Cloud via its cross-platform optimizer."

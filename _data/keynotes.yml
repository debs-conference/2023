#  abstract: "Freedom of the press is under threat worldwide, and the quality of information that people have access to is dangerously degraded, under the joint threat of non-democratic governments and fake information propagation. The press as an industry needs powerful data management tools to help them interpret the complex reality surrounding us. Since 2018, I have been cooperating with journalists from Le Monde, France’s leading newspaper, in devising tools for analyzing large and heterogeneuos data sources that they are interested in. This research has been embodied in ConnectionLens, a graph ETL tool capable of ingesting heterogeneous data sources into a graph, enriched (with the help of ML methods) with entities extracted from data of any type. On such integrated graphs, we devised novel algorithms for keyword search, and combine them in more recent research with structured querying. The talk describes the architecture and main algorithmic challenges in building and exploiting ConnectionLens graphs, illustrated in particular on an application where we study conflicts of interest in the biomedical domain. This is joint work with A. Anadiotis, O. Balalau, H. Galhardas and many others. ConnectionLens Web site (papers+code): https://team.inria.fr/cedar/connectionlens/. This research has been funded by Agence Nationale de la Recherche AI Chair SourcesSay (https://sourcessay.inria.fr)."
    
  biography: Boris Koldehofe is a Full Professor at the Technical University of Ilmenau, leading the Distributed and Operating Systems Group at the department of Computer Science and Automation. He received a Ph.D. degree from Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2005. Since then, he has worked in the field of distributed and network-centric computing systems at the EPFL (PostDoc), the University of Stuttgart, the Technical University of Darmstadt (Senior researcher and lecturer), and the University of Groningen (Full professor). He has a long-standing interest in event-based and stream processing systems covering issues related to scalability, performance, mobility, reliability and security. His current research focuses complementary on software-defined networks, adaptive communication middleware and distributed in-network computing. He has contributed to more than 100 scientific publications in major journals, e.g., the IEEE Transactions on Networking (ToN) and the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, and conferences, e.g., the ACM/USENIX Middleware and the ACM DEBS conferences. He has also contributed to many academic services at major conferences and journals. In the context of the ACM DEBS conference, he has served in several roles in the organizing and steering committee, e.g., as TPC Co-Chair in 2017, and as the General Chair in 2019. He has also served as a Tutorial Speaker for the ACM/USENIX Middleware, ACM DEBS, GI, and NetSys conferences.

  title: "Internet Computer Protocol: democratic evolution of a web3 platform"
  affiliation: DFINITY
  image: /img/keynotes/yap.jpg
  abstract: Recent technological advances have enabled the efficient execution of decentralized web3 applications and smart contracts. The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is a fast and efficient decentralized blockchain-based system for the execution of general-purpose applications in the form of smart contracts. In particular, the ICP’s execution, governance and evolution are controlled by different parties in a trustless and fault-tolerant manner instead of a central entity. In this talk, I will give an overview of the ICP, followed by a discussion of the challenges the IC faces to facilitate upgrading itself through voting by ICP token holders and present our approach to tackle them.

  biography: Yvonne-Anne Pignolet's work is centered around distributed systems, ranging from the design and analysis of algorithms for reliable and efficient distributed systems despite failures and malicious behaviour to complex network analysis. After her PhD at ETH Zurich in 2009 she was a postdoc at IBM Research Zurich and Ben Gurion University, Be'er Sheva. She worked for 8 years at ABB Corporate Research, Switzerland mostly devoted to research on communication systems for industrial and power systems, as a Principal Scientist in her final role. In 2019, she joined DFINITY, where she now leads teams of researchers building and improving the Internet Computer.

  title: "Metastability in the Metaverse"
  affiliation: Roblox, USA
  image: /img/keynotes/tania.jpg
  abstract: Roblox Metaverse supports an impressive 55M daily users. The underlying infrastructure is geographically distributed, with multiple edge data centers in all continents. The Metaverse stack consists of multiple layers of software systems, with complex dependencies that can be represented as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) or a multi-layered queueing system. In short, the concept of Metastability happens when each moving part of the stack works in harmony. In contrast, a Metastable failure results from a trigger originating in some part of the stack that cascades through multiple dependencies to finally affect a third-party system. Such kind of failure has large-scale consequences and can deem the overall stack unusable. The present talk will deep-dive in the characterization (or absence) of metastability based on a queueing theory model and analyze the dynamics that can lead to different flavors of system-wide failures. Furthermore, the model will be used as the basis to (mathematically) devise measures for the early detection of failures and explore fault-tolerance measures that ensure metastability.   
  biography: Dr. Tania Lorido-Botran is a Research Scientist at Roblox where she leads several efforts at the intersection of ML and Systems. Prior to that, she worked at Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. She was also a visiting PhD at Rice University. Dr. Lorido Botran received her PhD from the University of Deusto in Spain with a Cum Laude distinction. Her current research interests span across reinforcement learning, data center sustainability and fault-tolerance. She is also active in academia. She actively collaborates with universities and also serves as Program Committee member in several top-tier conferences, such as CCGRID or DISC.

#  abstract: "Materialize is a system that presents to users as SQL against continually changing data. It transforms inbound streams of *change data capture* events into streams that exactly correspond to transformed data, and maintains indexed representations of the results for efficient access and operation. SQL over changing data is surprisingly (for me) expressive: Materialize can operate on unbounded data, implement data-driven windows, and perform event-based queries, all with ANSI standard SQL. We will discuss what an event-based SQL system looks like, SQL idioms that give rise to traditionally stream-exclusive behavior, and how one architects such a system to scale across multiple dimensions."

  biography: Patrick is professor of computer science at the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Lugano, Switzerland, where he leads the Software Systems (SWYSTEMS) research group. Prior to that Patrick was a regular faculty member at Purdue University (2005–2016) and TU Darmstadt (2014–2017), and a visiting professor at MIT (2012–2013). His research has been awarded by several public funding agencies (e.g., NSF, ERC, DARPA, SNSF) as well as corporate partners (e.g., Cisco, Facebook, Google, HP, IBM, Meta, NetApp, Northrop-Grumman, SAP) through respective programs. Patrick is interested in all aspects of dependable distributed systems, in particular the intersection with programming languages and networks. Patrick served as PC chair for ACM OOPSLA’15, returning as associate PC chair for ACM OOPSLA’23, and currently serves as associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering. But before all that, Patrick started his academic path as an early contributor to event-based systems and DEBS, serving also as PC co-chair for DEBS'12, so he is particularly excited to return.
